Welcome to Amar Dokan! This project is a platform for managing customer information and performing CRUD operations.

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once these dependencies are installed, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/amar-dokan.git

```
2.Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
```
cd amar-dokan
npm install

```
3.Start the server:
```
npm start

```

The application will now be running at http://localhost:3000/.

In the frontend, i am using Bootstrap for styling. You can customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the Bootstrap themes and styles.

Thank you for using Amar Dokan! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue on the repository.
